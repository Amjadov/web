                            <div class="blog-content"> <strong>It's been two years since I first joined a gym, I remember the first day I started training, I was looking at the guys with their buffed chests and leg sized arms, while my arms looked like tiny hotdogs and my back was humped forward because it had no muscle or fat to support it. </p>
                                <p>The reason I joined was I was getting diabetes-like symptoms, dry mouth, headaches and a lot of visits to the toilet during the night, I went to see a doctor and did my blood work, "If you're not gonna be careful you will get diabetes my friend" is what he told me before letting me go home, so next day I told a friend of mine who lifts weights regularly and he told me to come with him to the gym and check it out, maybe I'll like it. </p>
								<p>Next day I went to the gym and at the front desk there was a gorgeous and fit sales lady waiting for new comers so she can "sell" them a membership, it only took her 5 minutes and I had already paid 4 months in advance, what can I say except she was really "convincing". </p>
								<p>First day of training was hard, no it was f##ing hard, I couldn't walk up the stairs of my house and I was miserable, I new it's not going to work, I won't be able to convince myself to do something I don't like, except if I set a goal for myself, something that will make me go to the gym no matter what I feel, so next day I went again and looked at the guys there, some of them were big and looked great, I picked one and said to myself, my goal is I want to look like this guy and I want to gain 15 kg of muscles.  </p>
								
								<p>That was a turning point for me, I became obsessed with my goals, I started reading books and watching videos of how to train, what to eat, how to speed up recovery, how to avoid injuries, it became a passion to me, pain and sorness from training became my favourite emotion like hot chili on a steak, it makes you cry in pain but you still love it. two years have passed and I'm really content with what I achieved, I gained 12 kg, I haven't reached my goals yet but I'm close.</p>

								<p>Motivation is the key to success, whether its your work, your health or your personal life, find what motivates you and you will surelly be happy and achieve success </p>
